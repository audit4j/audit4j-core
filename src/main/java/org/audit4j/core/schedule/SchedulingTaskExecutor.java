 * compatible with both Spring 4.0 and Spring 3.x.

     * A {@code SchedulingTaskExecutor} implementation can indicate whether it
     * prefers submitted tasks to perform as little work as they can within a
     * single task execution. For example, submitted tasks might break a
     * repeated loop into individual subtasks which submit a follow-up task

     * This should be considered a hint. Of course {@code TaskExecutor} clients
     * are free to ignore this flag and hence the {@code SchedulingTaskExecutor}
     * interface overall. However, thread pools will usually indicated a
     * preference for short-lived tasks, to be able to perform more fine-grained
     * scheduling.
