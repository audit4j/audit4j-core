/**
 * Task scheduler interface that abstracts the scheduling of {@link Runnable
 * Runnables} based on different kinds of triggers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface is separate from {@link SchedulingTaskExecutor} since it
 * usually represents for a different kind of backend, i.e. a thread pool with
 * different characteristics and capabilities. Implementations may implement
 * both interfaces if they can handle both kinds of execution characteristics.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The 'default' implementation is
 * {@link org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskScheduler},
 * wrapping a native {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService} and
 * adding extended trigger capabilities.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface is roughly equivalent to a JSR-236
 * {@code ManagedScheduledExecutorService} as supported in Java EE 6
 * environments. However, at the time of the Spring 3.0 release, the JSR-236
 * interfaces have not been released in official form yet.
